          A novena is typically nine days of prayer in preparation of a
          celebration of a feast day. At the National Shrine of The Divine
          Mercy, the Chaplet of Divine Mercy Novena is recited perpetually at
          the Hour of Great Mercy â€” the three o'clock hour. The Chaplet can be
          said anytime, but the Lord specifically asked that it be recited as a
          novena. He promised, "By this Novena (of Chaplets), I will grant every
          possible grace to souls."

        <article class="mt-3">
          For each of the nine days, our Lord gave Saint Faustina a different
          intention: All mankind, especially sinners; the souls of priests and
          religious; all devout and faithful souls; those who do not believe in
          God and those who do not yet know Jesus; the souls who have separated
          themselves from the Church; the meek and humble souls and the souls of
          little children; the souls who especially venerate and glorify His
          mercy; the souls detained in purgatory; and souls who have become
          lukewarm. "I desire that during these nine days you bring souls to the
          fountain of My mercy, that they may draw therefrom strength and
          refreshment and whatever grace they have need of in the hardships of
          life, and especially at the hour of death" (Diary, 1209).
