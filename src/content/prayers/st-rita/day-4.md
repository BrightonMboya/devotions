In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Intro Prayer

O Holy Patroness of those in need, Saint Rita, whose pleadings before thy Divine Lord are almost irresistible, who for thy lavishness in granting favors hast been called the Advocate of the hopeless and even of the Impossible.

Saint Rita, so humble, so pure, so mortified, so patient and of compassionate love for thy Crucified Jesus that thou couldst obtain from him whatsoever thou askest, on account of which all confidently have recourse to thee, expecting, if not always relief, at least comfort; be propitious to our petition, showing thy power with God on behalf of thy suppliant; be lavish to us, as thou hast been in so many wonderful cases, for the greater glory of God, for the spreading of thine own devotion, and for the consolation of those who trust in thee.

Daily Prayer

Glorious St Rita, you brokered peace between your husbandâ€™s family and the family of his murderer. We ask you to intercede anywhere in our lives where there is discord and hatred, and for all families affected by animosity.

We pray especially for (add your intention).

Amen.

Relying then upon thy merits before the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we pray thee obtain for us our request.

Concluding Prayer

Relying then upon thy merits before the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we pray thee obtain for us our request.

We honor thy perfect union with the Divine Will, thy heroic sufferings during thy married life, the consolation thou didst experience at the conversion of thy husband, the sacrifice of thy children rather than see them grievously offend God, thy miraculous entrance into the convent, thy severe penances and thrice daily bloody scourgings, thy suffering caused by the wound thou didst receive from the thorn of thy Crucified Saviour, thy divine love which consumed thy heart, that remarkable devotion to the Blessed Sacrament on which alone thou didst exist for four years, the happiness with which thou didst part from thy trials to join thy Divine Spouse, the perfect example thou gavest to people of every state of life.

Pray for us, O holy Saint Rita, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.
