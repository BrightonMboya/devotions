Glorious St Rita, you were famed for your compassion and wisdom and many people came to ask your help. Intercede for us that we can be open to others.

We pray especially for (add your intention).

Amen.

Concluding Prayer

Relying then upon thy merits before the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we pray thee obtain for us our request.

We honor thy perfect union with the Divine Will, thy heroic sufferings during thy married life, the consolation thou didst experience at the conversion of thy husband, the sacrifice of thy children rather than see them grievously offend God, thy miraculous entrance into the convent, thy severe penances and thrice daily bloody scourgings, thy suffering caused by the wound thou didst receive from the thorn of thy Crucified Saviour, thy divine love which consumed thy heart, that remarkable devotion to the Blessed Sacrament on which alone thou didst exist for four years, the happiness with which thou didst part from thy trials to join thy Divine Spouse, the perfect example thou gavest to people of every state of life.

Pray for us, O holy Saint Rita, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.
